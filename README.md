# PasswordManager

This is a simple password generator and manager written in C#. It allows you to generate strong random passwords and store them securely along with associated website and username.

## Features

- Password Generator: Generates strong random passwords containing alphanumeric characters and special symbols.
- Password Manager: Stores website, username, and associated passwords in a dictionary.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or copy the source code into a C# project in your development environment.

2. Compile the project to create the executable.

3. Run the executable to execute the sample program provided in the `Program` class.

## Usage

The sample program in the `Program` class demonstrates how to use the password generator and manager. It creates a random password, adds it to the password manager along with the website and username, retrieves the password for a specific website, and prints all saved passwords.
